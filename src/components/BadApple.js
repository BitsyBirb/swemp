    Will display an ASCII art display of Bad Apple. 

    At first just have it link to an embedded link of youtube's bad apple.
    Or Ronald McDonald madness.

    Format:
        Tiers of goals:
            1) 
                (MVP to start applying to jobs): Just an ASCII version of a single frame of bad apple 
                    OR
                (Link to the youtube video, maybe embed to play on my site)
            2) Actually play the entire thing in ASCII art. Would be really fuckign cool.
                Can probably find a library to turn a y outube video in ASCII art 

    Found the frames online at: https://github.com/trung-kieen/bad-apple-ascii/tree/main/frames-ascii
    Download folder and find a way to display these as ASCII thingies
    Dimensions: 36 rows of 96 characters each
        Shouldn't be insanely hard to display? No fucking clue
