// This file is basically just the driver code to keep App.js clean. 
// I don't really know what's going on, nor what I'm doing, but here we are.

// Started actual development on 1/20/25

// Finish initial product on: 

// Mainly a 4fun portfolio website as I'm bored as shit.
// Structure detailed below:

// Mainly just gonna be organizing the main terminal:
// Heavily based/inspired by the old ass computer terminals. Yknow. The neckbeard green text on a dimly lit screen ones.
// Think Fallout.

    Main Screen: Has five main options (text based inputs):
        1) About Page: Standard about me page. More on About.js
        2) Projects: Just a normal projects page. Maybe let them go to my GitHub off that.
        3) BadApple.js: Not standardly accessible, but will exist.

        Heavy Stretch Goal: Will require database
        4) Blurbs: Just random blurbs with dates and random info when I feel like yapping. (Stretch)
        Do this later on Github Pages tbh. Use a DB and routing service imo.
    
    Input: Text input into the text box (STRETCH GOAL: ADD FLICKERING CURSOR LIKE OLD TERMINALS)

    Has a state that is passed down into all of its children and can be updated in all of them (via clicks).
        This state/prop in question is just an apple counter. Why? Bad Apple.
